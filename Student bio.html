            <p>My name is Jeremy pollack, I am 19 years old. I was born in santa monica califorina. I have one dog at the moment,
                his name is Audi. I moved to Arizona when I was 5 years old. I have lived here ever since. Im a car guy,
                I love cars. I currently drive a BMW 328i E90 2011.
                <br> I went to elementry school here in Arizona, at a area called painted sky. Then middle school at Coronado
                K-8. Next was high school, I attended Ironwood Ridge High School for the rest of my High School education.
                <br>While I attended High School I worked at a retirement home in Oro valley, Arizona. I worked as a Server/Bartender
                there for just under two years. After High School I wanted to pursue my dream as a Front-end web developer,
                so I decided to Attend a course offered at the University of Arizona called Full Stack Web Developer Boot
                Camp.
